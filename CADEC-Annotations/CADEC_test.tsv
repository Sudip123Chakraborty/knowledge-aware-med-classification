Pain in left arm at night intense that I can't sleep and no position seems to relieve it. Have ceased to go to gym, as this is wholly impractical, given my loss of fitness. Pain is so intense that pain killers do not help. I cannot understand why this condition should come on so suddenly. It started with a flu-like symptoms, three to four weeks ago, followed by pains in my left knee. I am presently being tested for arthritus, but there is no history of arthritus in my family and I am just 61. The pain has been so intense that my life is being made a misery. Will now stop taking Liptor having read the comments on this site and hope I recover. Assuming Liptor is the culprit I am really annoyed with my doctor. and will tell him so. I went to him feeling totally OK nine months ago and he advised me to start taking this drug.

I then spent the night back in the ER for the severe pain. The doctor thought it was likely the codeine in the tylenol #3 but after reading all these comments, I doubt it very much.

The doc. put me on seroquel after I was diagnosed bi-polar, SO much worse than being crazy. I've been off both medications and have returned to normal.

Problem began while sitting at this computer. quick, sharp pain in center of chest, followed by a hot/heated flushing sensation that began mid-torso and continued up to the top of head (top of scalp started tingling and burning). Oddest feeling that I've ever experienced - very scary. Lasted approximately 45 seconds, followed by feeling of weakness and impending doom. By the time I arrived at the hospital I was shaking with chills uncontrollably. After tests were run I was told that it wasn't a heart attack or shroke. They said it was probably related to stress or a panic attack -- ridiculous because I haven't been stressed and have never had any problem similar. Definitely helped lower my cholesterol from 263 to 164 -- amazing, but I'm afraid to continue taking due to experiencing same severe side effects.

READ ----->. Be careful with this stuff. Had a total cholesterol of about 230. saw results after first 3 months. Had no other health concerns. Exercised on a regular basis and am in very good shape. This stuff grabbed me and ruined the this last year of my life. I have no other risk factors for heart desease except a moderatly elevated cholesterol level, no family history or anything. Thought I would take lipitor just to be safe. Big mistake. Went to my doctor and told him I wasn't going to take the lipitor any more. Told him I was presenting with some very adverse signs and symptoms and the only thing that had ever changed was the fact i was on Lipitor. He was not happy with my decision and offered a switch to a different statin, I declined. He got aggitated and asked what articles I had been reading and where I got my information. I told him I didn't need a medical journal to convince me this stuff was messing me up, I was living proof. 4-5 days after stopping the Lipitor it was like someonebrought the sun out. Depression faded along with all the other psychological enigmas I was dealing with. The only residuals I am now dealing with are some minor muscle aches and twitching, which are slowly getting better. Folks, drugs can be a wonderful thing but that doesn't mean all drugs are wonderful.

19	LIPITOR.176.txt	After about 4 years of taking Lipitor I started experiencing severe leg cramping at night with the pain traveling to my buddocks and stomach as well. The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil for the pain. I asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the Lipitor. Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinery tract infection and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again. I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any mor. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.

Looking back I realize now that I had symptoms early on but chose to overlook them. Bad choice on my part. I hope now that the 9 months of taking these meds hasn't caused permanent damage !!. After reading more about the medication I can only say that for me. I am done with taking statins. I will control my cholesterol by losing weight,exercise and diet.

I thought for sure that I was having a stroke. The hospital did a CT scan, MRI, MRA, Echocardiogram, Doppler of the Carotids, X-rays, and first termed it a TIA. But since that time the doctors have backed down from that diagnosis. A week later I had several (22) episodes of the body flushes (within a 5 hour period) which sent me back to the hospital. After several doctors, they are saying now that it was probably caused by the Lipitor. I am not taking it any more and have not had any episodes for 10 days.

After being on Lipitor for 2 years my knees and elbows were getting increasingly stiff and sore. I'm a painter by trade and largely attributed it to over use of my joints. Repetitive stress syndrome. I went to my doctor, he sent me to an arthritis specialist, I had x-rays. nothing was found. I felt like an old (older) man during this period, I thought I was finished in terms of my trade and the things I enjoy most, like hiking. My prescription of lipitor ran out a few months after these tests were done. I didn't bother refilling it right away and noticed my knees and elbows felt better. I renewed the prescription and no sooner had I started taking it again that I felt the stiff joints return. So I stopped taking it, the stiffness goes away, started again, stiffness returns. After telling my doctor this story, right away he says oh yeah, that's probably right Pardon!? So why didn't you mention that possibility before all the tests? (luckily since I live in Canada, these tests were all covered by our health care system) I didn't make the connection to lipitor earlier because stiff, swollen joints were not listed as one of the side effects.

But because of a high C-reactive protein level, I was prescribed Lipitor. After 3 months, My trigycerides and total cholesteral went down, even though they were fine to begin with, but my CRP level went UP!!! From 5.96 to 13.2!! Since treating the CRP levels was the initial purpose in prescribing me Lipitor, and since it did NOTHING to help these levels, I am therefore unsure if taking LIPITOR for high C-reactive protein levels is necessary, let alone effective.

I started taking 10 mg per day along with omega 3, fish oil, change in diet and exercise and reduced total, LDL and Tri's to acceptable levels within 3 mos. However, I tore my right Achilles tendon on 2/4/07 by just simply taking off from a sprinters stance. I then tore my left Achilles tendon on 10/26/08 by simply jumping in the air after my son won his playoff football game. Someone at the Dr's office recently recommended to me to do a search for possible connection between statin use and tendon damage/ruptures. Much to my surprise there is a significant amount of study and history of this connection. (Google statins tendon ) I have stopped the use of Lipitor immediately after finding out about this connection.

92	LIPITOR.83.txt	Have suffered from leg cramps(principally at night) since beginning 40 mg Lipitor, 5 years ago, after a mild heart attack. Cardiologist offered no suggestions. After trying numerous recommendation for this problem such as potassium, magnesium, vitamin E, etc with no effect, my family doctor suggested that I stop taking Lipitor for 3 days, and see if it has any effect. The effect was dramatic. The cramps did not occur during the night after I did not take the 40 mg with my dinner. They also did not occur on the following two nights. I did not want to restart the Lipitor (once a day with the evening meal) for fear that the cramps would just as quickly return. Since it was possible that the reason why the night cramps ceased so quickly is that I was taking the 40 mg entirely in the evening, I decided to split the pills and take half in the morning and half in the evening. Although some mild cramping did return, it was nowhere close to what I had been experiencing, and this has c. 	0	1	0	1	0	heart attack|night cramps|cramping|cramps|suffered|possible|problem|effect|5 years ago|decided|so quickly|Lipitor|vitamin E|Lipitor|potassium|magnesium|vitamin E|family|day|fear|leg|see|magnesium|vitamin E

95	ARTHROTEC.16.txt	I was prescribed this drug because I had spent a whole night in complete agony; abdominal pain, lower back pain, all that I imagine labor pain to be, except I was not in labor. Though the cause of my pain remains undetermined, the Arthrotec combined with Paracetamol pretty much eliminated the pain. This was a big relief, as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing. I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick. HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work. I still had the other Arthrotec pills left, so I took one. Although it alleviated the pain, I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week. I was relieved to read that this could be a side effect, as it means I probably don't have something serious, but I will have to be in some serious pain to risk bleeding from the vagina again. Next time I'll try my luck with Paracetamol.

99	LIPITOR.284.txt	Took 10mg lipitor for approximately one year. Experienced lethargy, tingling in arms, trouble sleeping, irritability, anxiety, mild depression. Finally went off all statins when I experienced a particularly bad reaction when the doctor, with a gleam in his eye, recommended combining lipitor with Zetia. The results were so bad in terms of side-effects that I ceased all statins and discontinued the Zetia in short order. I now take no statins, no Zetia. Individually they have their own problems; combined they are extremely dangerous and, in my opinion, should be banned as a combination therapy. Probably safe in short doses, a very bad candidate for long-term use unless closely monitored and used in lowest possible safe doseage. Would warn other patients to NOT COMBINE LIPITOR OR OTHER STATIN WITH Zetia, a common tactic that you will most likely regret.

100	LIPITOR.11.txt	I started taking Lipitor in Dec 2009. Experienced some leg muscle discomfort, but went away within a few weeks. In June, I ran out of my prescription, was busy, forgetful, stupid and didn't request a refill until about 2 weeks later. It took another week to get the prescription because I had switched doctors and the pharmacy didn't follow up. Anyway, after 3 weeks or so of not taking Lipitor, I started it again. Now a week later, I feel like I've been run over by a truck. I started having extreme muscle discomfort, achiness, cramps. I assumed it was due to my half-marathon training. I ran five miles last Saturday and expected to be sore for a day. But it has continued and gotten worse each day. I also started have muscle aches in my neck and shoulders and lower back. I couldn't figure out why. I also have felt extremely fatigued and people are telling me I look really tired and asking if I'm ok. I feel like I'm in a fog and it's a chore to just walk around.

102	LIPITOR.629.txt	Back pain, Lipitor seems to be involved. In November of 2005 I was prescribed Lipitor for elevated cholesterol. Not really high, but high enough, dosage was only 20 mg per day. Within two months, I had developed wicked back pain, along with neuropathy and hypersensitivity that wrapped around my abdomen. We suspected the Lipitor was involved, so I went off it, since my numbers had gotten really low. I was effectively laid up for about six months. Since there was no immediate improvement, we surmised that Lipitor wasn't causing this. It's October 2006 now, and I'm starting to feel more like myself, still hurts but I can work around it. The cholesterol has crept up, so two weeks ago we started the Lipitor again, and within a few days I was paractically flat on my back again! So, I've stopped again. It's a bloody shame this is happening, as the drug was extremely effective in dropping that cholesterol. Too bad, we're going to have to try something else, I guess. 	0	1	0	0	0	elevated cholesterol|neuropathy|prescribed|Back pain|something else|improvement|immediate|day|low|extremely|months|Lipitor|cholesterol|Lipitor|drug|cholesterol|abdomen|back|wicked|developed|shame|feel|like|pain|and hypersensitivity|bloody|dropping

Then I had to get a handicapped permit because I could not walk more than 25 steps. I could not sleep for the ache and discomfort in my legs. I was sure I was a few months away from a wheelchair. I was horribly depressed. When I asked my doctor about this pain, he took me off Lipitor, and within one week my pain had stopped completely. I can walk fine, I can even run. I sleep like a baby. However, I still cannot walk very far - I think I have lost a lot of muscle tone. I will have to build my strength back up in my legs.

I drank it some days during the first 2 weeks. Stopped drinking it. At the beginning of third week I took 50mg of CoQ10 per day for 3 days. I couldn't sense an improvement, but after stopping for other three days I will try again. (I need better evidence before buying a can of CoQ10, it is very expensive and hard to find around here).

158	LIPITOR.465.txt	I started taking Lipitor after my cholesterol climbed to 310. I Did not want to take it because I am a vegetarian, a health conscious person and dislike taking medicines, but my doctor, an endocrynologist, strongly recommended it. The first few months I was not aware of any side effects, but about a month ago I started to experience wrist pain, I thought it was my pilates class, but although I rested for 2 months from the class, the pain continued. Then about two weeks ago, I got very bad cramps in my toes, they curled down and the pain was terrible. About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher. I got scared that I was having something bad. After the cramps one night I had such tiredness in my left leg that I could hardly walk, I thought that it was my high heels that I had worn all day. Then 2 days ago I woke up with a swollen foot, it was very painful to walk. That was it. I suspected that it was the Lipitor and came to the internet and read the same side effects in a lot of people posting their experiences with this drug. I even thought that I had ALS since a friend of mine died of it. It is amazing the amount of people that also thought the same in this list. Thanks God for the Internet. I stopped taking this medicine 2 days ago, I hope that I can get rid of these effects and that they are not permanent.

162	LIPITOR.983.txt	Congestion, cough, elbows burning, right heel pain, loss of concentration. I initially couldn't tell I was taking it. About two years ago I started waking up with significant congestion with clear phlem. Chest xray was clear. My doctor suspected allergies. Having 2 pets that seemed reasonable. About a year ago my elbows would burn like fire at times when I rested my arms on a surface. This would come and go. I also began having trouble focusing while reading and would skip around. Two months ago my right heel became painful for no reason. The more I walked on it the worse it felt. I switched shoes with no change. It hurt enough that I began to worry I might end up on disability if it got much worse. I was recently out of state for two weeks and still had congestion in spite of being in a totally different environment. That was when I suspected the Lipitor and did some research on line and saw matches with all of my symptoms. I immediately stopped it and the next morning the congestion was 80% less. I saw my doctor who agreed I need to stop it. He explained that there are a lot of side affects and there is no way to predict who will get which ones or when they will develop. The blood tests give a false sense of security since the results (like mine) can be normal yet other serious issues can develop. 	0	1	1	0	0	concentration|like|affects|security|blood tests|Congestion|congestion|allergies|disability|worse|worry|skip|come and go|cough|right|switched|heel pain|burning|painful|symptoms|Lipitor|Lipitor|waking|normal|year|immediately|months|Chest|arms|elbows|burn|fire|heel|saw|develop

My first night - the soundest sleep in over four years! without pain killers for the constant trigeminal neuralgis (a side benefit to be sure). Not happy about the idea of statins - strange psychic events when my mother was taking them (Zocor) - too strange to repeat in a public forum. So I am here looking for information about the side effects - anecdotally presented - as the web site for Lipitor does not have the information that would typically come on the drug sheet .

169	LIPITOR.972.txt	I am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005. The patient data is reported for him by me. Briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer). That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. There were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards. My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient. He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards). I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this. My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days. Don't know if this will really help anybody -- but just please be cautious with Rx medicines and advocate for yourself; you may not know everthing, but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these Rxs. keep doing your research, tell your doctor anything you find relevent about your life as it relates to Rxs you are given, and advocate hard for your quality of life. 	1	1	1	0	0	environmental exposure|damage|unable to speak|work history|Don't know|bedridden|speak|related|10 days|2 months|quality of life|illness|deterioration|brain cancer|cancer|risk factors|standards|normal|model|given|year|help|aggressive|months|experiences|experience|listen|drive|diagnosed|reporting|reported|patient|Lipitor|cholesterol|prior|Lipitor|drug|cholesterol|medicines|There|prior|medicine|cardiac|data|cane|died|see|efforts|neurological|diagnosis|lipid

192	LIPITOR.899.txt	I started to take 20 mg lipitor in August 2006, after 6 months, I reduced to take 10 mg, and after another 6 months, I reduced the lipitor intake to 5 mg. During all these 18 months, my LDL and cholesterol in 70s and 120s and I did not feel much side effects. When I incresed lipitor from 5 mg to 10 mg about 3 months ago, I started to experience the following side-effects started at different time: loss body balance, joint pain, muscle aches, weak legs, and some memory loss. About 2 months ago while I first told my doctor I lost some body balance and it might be due to lipitor buy my doctor told me the side effect was most likely by some other reason(s). During my second visiting him, he told me my blood test CK is 90 and my muscle should be OK. Then I continued to take 10 mg lipitor, but I felt more on muscle and joint pain and I started to feel I lost some memory. Therefore, I deeply believed that I had side effects by taking lipitor. After about a week to 10 day without lipitor, I got my memory back to nomal level and my body balance is getting better. During my third doctor visit, my doctor finally believed that I got bad side effects and he told me it would take months for recovery. Now my doctor wants me to take B3 or Niaspan instead of lipitor. 	0	1	1	0	0	I had side effects|effect|likely|memory|effects|2 months|continued|side effects|body balance|recovery|muscle aches|joint pain|weak|memory loss|experience|feel|blood test|lipitor|Niaspan|cholesterol|lipitor|Niaspan|cholesterol|visit|legs|and muscle|week|day|months|back

Now I'm on Crestor and just started having even worse side effects :o(. This medication DID help lower my cholesterol, I was close to 300 when I started it (and I did eat healthy and exercise moderately at the time, it's hereditary for me). and I was taking 40 mg. to get my cholesterol down around 200. My mother has taken it for even longer at max dose (80 mg) and has had no side effects she attributes to the medication.

It doesn't instantly improve with stopping the meds either, even though doctors may say it will after 1 month. It takes at least 3+ months for the drug to get out of your system according to pharmacists- but you still may have pain that continues after that. I recommend the website spacedoc.net for lots of info, reccommended supplements, and help on this.

I started taking Lipitor about three weeks ago and felt the before mentioned symptoms almost immediately. At first I thought it was the stress of Christmas. However I did consider the side effects of Lipitor I read in other websites. I stopped taking Lipitor for about a week and felt somewhat better, Christmas over by then, once again I considered stress as the cause and not Lipitor. I went back on Lipitor about a week ago and feel horrible again. Found this website and no longer doubt the source of pain, etc is definitely from taking Lipitor. I am seeing my GP this afternoon and I am taking myself off this drug and will seek a natural method of lowering my cholesterol. 	0	1	1	0	0	flu like symptoms|lack of energy|exhaustion|body pain|pain|symptoms|side effects|big toes|brain|hands|and muscle|Lipitor|cholesterol|Lipitor|drug|cholesterol|website|method|week|websites|immediately|definitely|stress|source|Found|sensitivity|somewhat|seeing|lowering|doubt|feel|neck|arms|back|cold|tingling|severe

Possibly increased hair loss - (and I am female so it is really unfortunate) but thinning hair among women at my age also runs in my mothers family so can't really blame statins. I have a lipid problem that doesn't respond to diet or exercise. Agressive cholesterol management is my only option. Liptor works. I take 40mgs/day, may be able to lower it since my total cholesterol dropped from 300 to 120 in two months. My doctor put me on CoQ 10 at the same time as the Lipitor, and explained possible side effects. Lipitor actually reversed blockages in one of my brothers. 4 out of 5 of us are on statins - 3 Lipitor. No serious bad effects.

My total cholesterol did drop from 6.5 mmol/l to 3.6 but my HDL also dropped to below 1 mmol/l actually making my good/bad cholesterol ratio worse. Because I felt so ill, I stopped taking it. Cholesterol went up almost immediately after stopping Lipitor and I felt great again and was able to run again. A year later I tried Lipitor again with the same side effects as before. I stopped taking it and decided to live with high cholesterol as taking this drug made my life not worth living. 	0	1	0	0	0	total cholesterol|high temperature|muscle pain|ill|high cholesterol|unable|worse|able|run|decided|side effects|Cholesterol|cholesterol ratio|stopping|stopping|Lipitor|drug|Lipitor|Severe|year|immediately
295	LIPITOR.339.txt	I was a vibrant healthy woman until Easter Saturday, 2006. On Easter Sunday my ankles, feet, wrists, and knees seized up. I am now off Lipitor and I am assured that I will make a full recovery within six months. I shuffle when I walk and I am only just coping. I am not quite a vegetable, but not far off. I started using the drug in Sept. 2005. In October/November I noticed my hands were nowhere near as strong as they once were - thought it was old age. I also had a strange senistivity in the palms and soles of my feet, also in my scalp - it was uncomfortable blowing my hair dry. It was not a tingling, just a sensitivity. In November, I was running, and my feet felt like led - thought it was old age. In December, my ankles started aching - gee, am I getting old! In January, I started to go to the gym, and I think that this is where my problems really started. My already over-streesed muscles, over a short period of time, went into meltdown. This drug is a terrible, terrible drug and should not be prescribed for anyone. 	0	1	0	0	0	short period|hair dry|shuffle|problems|sensitivity|prescribed|Lipitor|Lipitor|drug|blowing|ankles|wrists|soles|aching|knees|hands|scalp|feet|think|like|recovery|months|tingling

I kept asking my doctor if there were any side effects like mine and he said no. I had been taking zocor with no problem but insurance company wouldn't pay for it anymore and made me go on lipitor. After about six months I had my docteor write a letter to ins. co. saying I couldn't take lipitor and they agreed to put me back on zocor. But the long term effect of those six months sent me into a psyhcological tailspin that I never recovered from. I went to three psychiatrist and they finally came up with a diagnoses of bipolar disorder. Cause unknown. This was three years ago. The drug ruined my life, I am now seperated after this all occurred and before the lipitor I was an energtic happy family man with a great wife and two kids. I know it was the lipitor because the only other medication I take is an aspirin once a day. 	0	1	1	0	0	long term effect|other medication|lipitor|zocor|drug|ringing|side effects|depression|sleeping|recovered|negative|problem|unknown|diagnoses|disorder|said|lipitor|zocor|aspirin|ringing|letter|family|day|immediately|insurance|months|happy|like|back|aspirin

After the second pill the same progression of symptoms only now the abdominal gas,cramps and pain would be with me all day. I stopped pills but abdominal cramps persist. The only good thing I can say about Arthrotec is that I did notice pain relief but I won't put up with the side effects on a daily basis since I spent a long time getting rid of a reflux problem in the past. The abdominal gas,cramps and discomfort are another thing I don't want to see get worse if I keep taking Arthrotec. I've taken Tylenol 3 and never had a problem like this.
