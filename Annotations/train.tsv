My advice to you would be to listen to your BODY, it may be trying to tell you something.

8	LIPITOR.614.txt	After a routine check up my cholesterol level was found to be sky high. So two months ago the internist put me on Lipitor for high cholesterol. The lipitor helped in reducing the cholesterol level by 20%. The side effects were terrible! I had for a number of years pain in my hipjoints. The lipitor increased the pain tenfold. I could hardly walk, sit or drive the car. The pain I was experiencing especially around the hipjoints was incredible. I told the specialist about these side-effects and he told me to reduce the dose from 1 a day to 1 every two days!? I had already stopped taking the lipitor for a week and the pain had decreased somewhat. I learned from the pharmacist that this drug can cause wasting of muscles and that it was possible to end up in a wheelchair because of it!! I am going to start on alternative medicines.

This is too low in my opinion and my body began attacking my CNS and now have to live with this. Again, this has not yet proven, nor have i gone down that road yet.  Big Pharma wants to promote the use of statins to treat MS, when I stopped taking mine (Jan 2010)that is when my symptoms became present?? I may have been the human rat in that theory.

17	LIPITOR.242.txt	SEVERE AND UNCHARACTERISTIC DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AGGRESSION, AND MOOD SWINGS. I cannot stress this enough- my personality comepletely changed after beginning this medication. I am typically an easy going, positively thinking, emotionally stable, and motivated person. But after starting Lipitor I've gradually descended into a world of extreme anxiety, hopelessness, lonliness, and self loathing. I've never in my life been so depressed, so obsessively focused on morbid, terrifying thoughts, or so negative about everything in my life. After being off of this medication for only 48 hours, I am already beginning to see an improvement in my moods, but this will be a long journey back to my old self, I feel. Oh yes, and I also suffered from: Gas, Constipation, EXTREME FATIGUE, weight gain and bloating, and occassional bouts of diaharrea. It lowered my cholesterol, to be sure. But it also significantly lowered my quality of life. This website has been an absolute lifeline for me. My doctor had seemed so completely unwilling to accept that my symptoms could've possibly been related to my taking Lipitor. However, I know my body and know when things are not as they should be. I have been feeling this way since almost immediately after I took my first dose. Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication. So many of my family members and friends have had bad reactions to this stuff- I can not trust it, and will be looking for another way to get my cholesterol under control, if possible. Be very careful and very informed before you start any new medication. Don't always trust the word of your doctor as the only word and take it at its face value.

18	FLECTOR.1.txt	"Started experiencing pain in my right heel when walking in mid-November; it got worse over time so I went to see my orthopedist in early December and he said I had plantar fasciitis; he showed me stretching exercises and advised me to get inserts for my walking shoes, wear cushioned house slippers and avoid walking up inclines. The pain lessened by following all these recommendations but I was still uncomfortable a lot of the time. I finally went to see the orthopedist in March and he said my foot ""can"" improve if I continued with the exercises, etc At the very end, he asked if he had given me the ""patch"" at my first appointment; so I left with a sample and a prescription for the Flector patch. I cut a patch (there are five in each reclosable pouch) in half and it covers the heel area. After I used it the first time, the puffiness and pain were gone! I found it best to use the patch at night only although you can replace it every 12 hours. I put the patch on at bedtime, tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it. Initially, I used it every night and after about three weeks, was able to cut down to several times a week. It certainly helped to make the past month more comfortable.

The doc put me on birth control. But, the bleeding has not subsided. So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed. I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect. When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy/extra vaginal bleeding. I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday,. Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly., On top of that, I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure. I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this. I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week, yet I am still bleeding. I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks, but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them.

This in turn has seriously upset my stomach which the doctor prescribed yet another drug for. 40 mg dose Lipitor worked well in reducing my overall cholesterol levels; which are high in my family. The last 6 months of my life have been a health nightmare. I was a fit, strong and very active person 5 years ago. Now I am struggling walking too far and functioning in general.

44	LIPITOR.458.txt	Terrific cramps in legs and awful gas pains in abdomen and back for the last month at least. It lowered my LDL (not enough) but also lowered my HDL as well!! The ratio is not good!. I started taking Lipitor about 3 yrs. ago. I started at 20. then my Dr doubled it to 40 and kept wanting me to double it again to 80. After me telling him for months I would not do this. I gave it (about 2 months ago) but decided to go to 60 rather than 80. Well, let me tell you after taking this increased dosage for about two months I've had such gas pains around my abdomen and my back and also leg cramps. I finally went to see a Dr in Urgent Care as the pain was so severe. He examined me and could not find any swellings etc and asked me if I had done anything different with my meds. I told him I had increased the Lipitor and he suggested that I stop taking it ASAP. I only stopped taking it last night and I am anticipating that I will feel better (I like to be physical and do lots of walking). I tried Crestor a little while ago and ended up in the Emergency Dept. of a hospital here with heart palipations. I'm not really very confident in these STATINS!!!

Thankfully statins have done me a POWER OF GOOD so far. High cholesterol is in my genes; it killed my dad died at age 58 when I was just 14. I'm now 57 (male) and hope to go on a bit longer :o) Note: I live in the UK and Europe has a different cholesterol measurement system of mmol/litre versus the USA system of mg/decilitre. Conversion rate: mmol/L x 38.5 = mg/dL.

89	LIPITOR.956.txt	When I began taking Lipitor I had what the doctors referred to as TIA's. Loss of balance, loss of speech and after several months I began having seizure type symptoms. I have been seeing a Neurologist since I was told I was having TIA's. I have gone through a TEE and a brain catheter and everything came back normal. The Neurologist told me to stop taking Liptor one week ago and I am starting to feel a little better. I am still feeling extremely tired.

91	LIPITOR.646.txt	Was on Lipitor 10 mg per day for about 5 years and experienced chronic and acute back pain which gradually improved but seemed strange to me because I hadn't really done anything to strain my back muscles. New doc gave me a different statin but I had leg cramps so he put me on Baycol. Baycol was removed from market so next doc put me back on Lipitor. My cholesterol level increased to slightly over 200 so my doc increased dosage to 40 mg a day. Hand and leg cramps returned. Hands diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome and I wore a hand brace to sleep several nights a week which controlled the symptoms. Recently developed inflammation of my foot muscles and joints and (apparently) plantar fasciitis of my left foot. Doc prescribed 800 mg Motrin qid but the foot problems became worse. General weakness in my feet, calves, and hands and tingling and burning in the soles of my feet. Depression, for which I've been taking an SSRI for about two years and may not be related to the Lipitor. I had high cholesterol (over 350) and was prescribed Lipitor in 1996 after other methods failed to have much effect. I have taken two stress tests over the past ten years and was told I had a healthy cardiovascular system with no trace of heart disease. I am 6' tall, weighed 177 lbs., and considered myself healthy until recently. I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test, including a 1.5 mile run, every 6 months because I'm in the military. I took myself off Lipitor because I can not take the physical readiness test. In fact I need a cane in the morning to get out of bed. I am not overweight. I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms, which have continued to worsen. Until recently I walked to work and shopping, 4 or 5 miles most weekdays, and more on the weekends. I also ran 2 miles, 3 times a week. Now I have difficulty walking and problems with my balance and I've gained 10 pounds because I've become sedentary. Two days after taking myself off Lipitor my feet have improved a little and I'm looking forward to resuming a more active lifestyle. I think my symptoms are a result of Lipitor. 	1	1	1	0	0	carpal tunnel syndrome|plantar fasciitis|heart disease|inflammation|tingling|difficulty walking|high cholesterol|foot problems|overweight|readiness|10 pounds|improved|3 times|effect|worsen|worse|able|run|and problems|past ten years|related|controlled|sleep|miles|slightly|5 years|increased|continued|cholesterol level|acute back pain|leg cramps|weakness|burning|symptoms|strain back|cardiovascular|soles|back|foot muscles|left foot|Hands|hands|Hand|hand|feet|stress tests|diagnosed|prescribed|General|physical|Depression|military|methods|week|test|day|Doc|months|Lipitor|Baycol|Motrin|statin|active|Lipitor|Baycol|Motrin|statin|stretch|and exercise|brace|cane|balance|developed|think|experienced|shopping|active|trace

106	LIPITOR.92.txt	Muscle aches and weakness in neck, arms, shoulders, upper back, legs. Severe pain in left foot and third and fourth toes. Pain and weakness increased until I needed help dressing and combing my hair. I could not do daily activities such as pick up a cup of coffee or put on a seatbelt without significant pain. The ball of my left foot was so painful I could not put pressure on it when walking so I walked on the side of my foot. Symptoms began 12 weeks after starting Lipitor. I reported to my cardiologist and internist who both denied problems were related to Lipitor because my CPK was only mildly elevated (250). I also saw a podiatrist, chiropractor, and spine specialist with no relief. When it got so bad I could not take it anymore and did not care about my cholesterol I took myself off of Lipitor and got a 50% improvement after one week. I then saw a neurologist who diagnosed me with statin induced myalgia. He said he sees a lot of patients with slightly elevated CPK that many physicians do not recognized as a symptom of a statin intolerance. I have been off of Lipitor for two years and continue to improve very slowly, but I still suffer from some pain and weakness.

The next day, I felt stabbing pain in my spine and I thought I had thrown my back out. I was hunched over to the left and figured it would take a week to get better, but the pain vanished after a little more than a day. I started feeling an odd sensation in the center back of my calves. I put weight on suddenly for no reason and ringing in my left ear increased. Next the calf sensation turned painful at night and started increasing. I figured out these issues all might be caused by Lipitor and stopped taking it immediately. But the pain in my calves continued to get worse for several days! My legs were waking me up at night and were all contorted.

134	LIPITOR.216.txt	9/20/05. I've been taking cholesterol lowering meds for at least 10 years including Mevacor, Zocor, Lipitor and Zetia. My cholesterol went from 398 to 260 on 40 Lipitor. This year I was given 80 mgs of Lipitor and Zetia was added as well. Along with the increased dosage, came crippling pain in my back, neck and then just my left foot, severe pain in my neck to the point where I couldn't hold it up without an effort, increased sinus pain, high blood pressure, insomina, blurred thinking. So to fix all these problems, I was given lots of other meds and tons of physical therapy and exercise each day. All so I could have great numbers. Finally, I realized enough was enough, I called the nurse practitioner to say I was stopping Lipitor and she was not really happy to put it mildly. I know my cholesterol will always be high, but after 2 weeks off Lipitor, I feel better each day and know it's not my age causing the pain, high blood pressure, memory loss, dizzines. 	0	1	0	1	0	pain in back|pain in neck|sinus pain|pain|dizzines|blood pressure|physical|memory loss|left foot|thinking|happy|feel|stopping|stopping|Mevacor|Lipitor|Zocor|Zetia|cholesterol|Mevacor|Lipitor|Zocor|Zetia|cholesterol|therapy|and exercise|severe|effort|lowering|given|year|day|10 years|neck|problems|know cholesterol|increased|practitioner|added

Insomnia, I would wake up at 3:00 am and be unable to go back to sleep. Difficulty in swallowing and constipation. I went to 3 different doctors for these symptoms. All of them dismissed my view that maybe the Lipitor was causing all of this even though the symptoms started about 3 weeks after uping the dosage from 20 mg. to 40. I quit taking Lipitor about a week ago - thanks in part to this web site. Within 3 days I was no longer consistently waking up at 3:00 am unable to go back to sleep. Headaches seem to be dissipating as well, and the extreme fatigue is disappearing. I don't expect MD's to be knowledgeable about every drug and I recognize that this drug has probably saved a lot of lives, but it is the attitude that I find irresponsible, that these problems couldn't possibly be caused by Lipitor since as all the doctors said. 	1	1	0	0	1	extreme fatigue|headaches|fatigue|symptoms|knowledgeable|swallowing|Insomnia|probably|unable|lives|Headaches|problems|irresponsible|completely|sleep|Difficulty|very bad|possibly|attitude|experienced|Lipitor|Lipitor|drug|waking|wake|back|week|constipation|months|said|SEVERE

150	LIPITOR.780.txt	SEVERE FATIGUE IN MY BODY AND TIREDNESS AND MUSCLE PAINS IN MY HIPS THAT CONTINUE TO THIS DAY AFTER BEING OFF THE DRUG FOR ALMOST A YEAR. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against. I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing. I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again. I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time. This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug. This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage. My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol. I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor. He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed. I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up!

162	LIPITOR.457.txt	Was put on 10mg, the lowest dose. I experienced cramping in my stomach, and some muscle side effects. I decided to go off of it after a few months. When my Cholesterol shot up to 300, I reconsidered and tried it again. But I cut the dosage in half with a pill cutter taking only 5mg per day. This is something people should consider. Where the first time my cholesterol went down to 188 with 10mg, on 5mg it went down to 198. it has since gone up to 220 on that dosage but still a far cry from 300. But now (after about 9 months) I am once again considering going off of it. I have terrible constipation and have been having bad muscle pains. in my neck and shoulders, lower back and right hip, Then the other day it was on the news that a study showed statin drugs can CAUSE heart problems. and CANCER especially in the elderly. It also said that 7 our of 10 researchers who told us they should lower the bar on cholesterol levels (meaning more people should take it at lower numbers) were connected to the drug companies who make and sell it!!!!. 	0	1	0	0	0	cholesterol levels|Cholesterol|study|heart problems|muscle pains|cramping|side effects|lower back|shoulders|right hip|neck|stomach|and muscle|CANCER|drugs|drug|statin|cholesterol|news|day|constipation|months|said|cut|experienced|cutter|statin|cholesterol|decided|connected

167	ARTHROTEC.42.txt	"Stomach pains, chest pains, anxiety, fatigue, headache, erratic heart beat, raised blood pressure, dizziness, nausea (even when taken with food), blurred vision. I was given a 6 day trial of Arthrotec along with a 9 day trial of Aciphex on 4/25 (three bottles of three pills). This was a solution my doctor came up with. I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps. I was at work, so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start). So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it. On the evening of 4/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an ""I just finished running!"" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs. I literally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5/1), I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened. I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work. A friend at work had to call an ambulance. I was filled in by the ER doc that the mixture of Aciphex and Arthrotec was insane and that he was trying to keep from cracking up at my primary doc's decision to combine them.

Hospitalized and cathed again but heart arteries were fine and previously placed stents open Dr stopped blood pressure meds and Lipitor. He was back to normal in a week.

I have a high tolerance for pain, so the pain wasn't an issue, but I feel like I've aged 20 years! I've slowed down considerably and don't have the tolerance I once did. My short-term memory disappeared. Not that I would have noticed, but my wife was getting increasingly mad at my apparent lack of attention! I'm going off this drug and trying the vitamin C approach.

254	LIPITOR.3.txt	I started taking Lipitor in December 2009 and stopped after 4 months. During this time I experienced extreme pain in both shoulders, sometimes in the neck also, causing me to wake several times each night. Pain was worse in the morning but rarely went away completely during the day. Most mornings it was impossible to wash my hair in the shower as I was unable to reach the top of my head with my hands. Pain and restricted movement often prevented me from putting on shoes and socks without assistance. In January this year I started experiencing discomfort in my left hand for the first time. Now in both hands, the pain has increased, fingers are swollen and movement is restricted. My wife tells me my hands are warm to touch. The mornings are worse when they hurt the most, movement is restricted and it is impossible to make a fist. Ice and ibruprofen gel help but only for a short while. I have been taking 400 mg Ibruprofen 3 times daily for a couple of weeks on my doctors advice without. This drug is clearly POISON to so many people and perhaps there is good reason to take Pfizer to the courts. However I do believe that any Doctor prescribing Lipitor should make it abundantly clear to the patient that very serious consequences could ensue that would cause extreme pain and could effect quality of life. I believe that failure to do so is a serious deriliction of duty that should be tested with complaints to the medical authorities that oversee our doctors and/or the courts. 	1	1	0	0	0	quality of life|discomfort|pain|top of head|shoulders|neck|warm to touch|complaints|swollen|3 times|unable|effect|worse|Pain|completely|impossible|4 months|increased|prescribing|advice|assistance|patient|Lipitor|Ice|Lipitor|drug|Ice|fingers|hands|hair|hand|tested|year|help|day|putting on shoes|restricted|wake|Ice|experienced|couple|often|movement

I have gout and had been attributing the joint pain to that, but after bloodwork, my rheumatologist said it was not gout! I have an appt. scheduled to start to deal with this pain but an experience last night and reading some postings on this site are leading me to suspect the lipitor. My usual 20mg dose is taken with dinner, but I had forgotten to take it and remembered just before bedtime. I awoke at 3AM with an a knee that was just throbbing with pain. I hobbled to the bathroom and took a dose of Advil and was able to get back to sleep after about a half hour. I awoke this morning with about a 50% reduction in pain and it seems to have subsided as the day goes on. I will never take lipitor before bed again, I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level. Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180's. I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240's. The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor. So, all in all, the lipitor has done a good job. I will try to cope with the joint pain, but if it becomes a constant problem, I will have to stop taking the drug. 	1	1	1	0	0	cholesterol levels|good cholesterol|muscle soreness|joint pain|pain|arms and legs|knees|knee|experience|remembered|reduction|lipitor|Lipitor|Advil|lipitor|Lipitor|Advil|drug|problem|able|rising|sleep|possibly|Slight|start|day|scheduled|gout|said|back|elbows|cut

Sure enough, every night I took the medication I had the severe cramps/pains but the nights I didn't take it, either I didn't experience the pain at all or it was at a much lesser degree. After a few days, I stopped taking Lipitor for a 2 week period and noticed that all my symptoms improved and the muscle pains and cramps completely resolved. I notified my doctor.

When I thought I was having a heart attack they admitted me to emergency room and overnight stay. No real heart problems - but weak heart muscle - likely cause of Lipitor. Lower legs have been hurting for over one year since I stopped taking meds. Doctors just conducted biopsy of leg muscle because it is inflamed and waiting for results. Likely not good. Also much fatigue then - and now. DO NOT TAKE STATINS - and if you do I hear the CQ10 is a good protector for some of the muscle damage that the statins can cause.

Have been on Lipitor for approx. 2 1/2 years. Within 5 months experienced alopecia, which I had never had before and excused as stress related. Nausea and vomiting began several months later, if taken within a 3-4 hours of eating. Then within a year of being on the medication, I experienced severe facial paralysis diagnosed as Bell's Palsey. Severe hip and back pain followed, along with depression, thoughts of suicide and paranoia. The overwhelming exhaustion that I felt every morning for over a year intensified. I have tried altering when I take Lipitor but it did not help with the nausea. I stopped taking the Lipitor 45 days ago after I began to experience hair loss again. I researched Lipitor in a pharmacy book and realized hair loss, along with most of my other ailments, were side effects. I started noticing improvement during the first 30 days.

I was in otherwise good health before starting, although it's only been a week. It should be noted that this is my third time trying this med. I am not drinking the koolaid on this miracle drug. I think it has major side effects that the mfgs are still not attributing to the drug. There is a lot of good reads out there, including articles in the NY times - do some research - it seems a lot of us are on the fence.

441	LIPITOR.870.txt	A few years after the dosage was raised to 40 mg, I began to have a sharp pain in the ball of my right foot, diagnosed as a neuroma. (It seemed more like metatarsalgia to me.) Then the left foot started hurting also. I nearly stopped walking for 6 months, hoping to get better to avoid surgery. I stopped Lipitor as an experiment, and after 3 days the pain changed completely. It began to heal after that. Every week since has been a marked improvement. After 7 weeks, it's nearly healed. I can again hike for miles without the horrible pain I experienced for over 6 months while taking this drug. Lipitor did control cholesterol, but isn't it really inflamation causing heart disease and stroke, and not the cholesterol? Is everyone barking up the wrong tree here?

447	LIPITOR.14.txt	Soon after starting Lipitor I developed extreme pain in both inner arms at the elbows, over the next years I developed inflammed ligaments and bursae in my shoulders and ankles. Also Nerve pain in shoulders, ankles and feet. Finally extreme burning of shoulders and ankles. I was started on Liptor 20 mg 7 years ago. It was increased to 40 mg. 3 years ago. The pain increased proportionately to the time I was on the drug and the dose increase. Neither my doctors nor I ever related these pains to Lipitor. I stopped Lipitor six months ago as an experiment. Within 3 weeks I had recovered about 50%. I hve not recovered past this point. I still can't walk without extreme pain. I have to wear ankle supports, night splints, ice compresses frequently, gel pads, elevated heels. My shoulders are doing better than my ankles and feet, but they still hurt. My GP and the surgeon who says I now need surgery on both ankles for the inflammed bursae are reluctant to connect my pain and disability. My GP still wants me on statins. She is annoyed that I will not take any. I am taking Red Yeast Rice with COQ10 now instead of a statin along with 2000 mg of Vitamin C daily. Basically Lipitor has ruined my formerly active life. No more dancing, golf, hiking, even standing too long sets my ankles on fire. I will have my cholesterol rechecked in September to see if the Red Yeast Rice helps my elevated cholesterol.

It is a miracle drug along with Vitamin E and additional Premarin. My cholesterol was over 600 a number of years back. I've tried at least 5 other meds for this condition but this one is most effective. The lowest the other ones took it was to 300. My endocrinologist thought this was going to be the best it could be controlled. So, I really believe in this drug, but must consider what it may be doing to my body and my degree of pain. I have taken Lipitor since it was approved 4 or so years ago. If anyone has any experience like mine, please email me.

After one week off the drug I still have severn leg cramps and went in for another doctors visit and he said he didn't thiink it was a Lipitor side effect because the cramps were localized and felt maybe the cramps were caused by a muscle enemze. He drew blood and is running tests. About the same time I got the leg cramps my right knee swelled up so I saw another doctor and I don't know if the knee and leg cramps are related side effects. Anyway I asked the second doctor about Liptior side effects re. leg cramps and he felt that the side effect could be localized and that the cramps could.

Problem solved! Was on the meds for 7 days when I experienced chest discomfort and upper abdominal pressure. With a medical background, I know that cardiac symptoms are mistaken for gastric reasons so I went to the ER. Long story short, I was diagnosed with severe gastric distress (GERD) and with a ""gastric cocktail"" and a high octane prilosec, I had some serious relief and sent home. Not convinced it was the issue, I went a day without the RX and then started again. I wasn't entirely 100% after taking the dose and now, I am fairly certain it was the Voltaren.

Lipitor does help reduce total serum cholesterol considerably in many patients but the side effects of this 'poisonous' medication are extremely alarming.

Not sure of how tight the correlation is between low chlosterol numbers and low risk of coronary problems.

514	LIPITOR.94.txt	I have done very well with Lipitor for the last 2 1/2 years. It has reduced my cholesterol significantly-from over 300 to under 150. Two weeks ago I was given the new generic. This week I noticed that all my fingers and toes were tingling, a pins and needles feeling. It was like they had fallen asleep. I immediately went back to pharmacy and got brand name again (luckily my insurance pays-it will be $15/ 3 month supply more, but it's worth it). I have noticed just within the last two days the tingling is gone. Thank goodness! I read that generics have the same active ingredients, but there may be a difference in how the medicine is released. It's not EXACTLY the same. High cholesterol runs in my family and I am greatful that Lipitor can help me manage this. 	0	1	0	0	0	High cholesterol|tingling|brand name|pharmacy|family|given|month|week|help|immediately|insurance|Lipitor|active|cholesterol|Lipitor|generic|generics|cholesterol|medicine|fingers|toes|needles|pins|feeling|like|asleep|runs|new|back|released|difference|active

Blurred vision (thought eyes tested fine during last visit to eye doc) and joint pain. Bypass @40yr + diabetic. Was put on lipitor immediately before the surgery 1.5 years ago. Had initial funny feeling in the head after starting the medicine, but (as it seems) began to tolerate. Have well controlled diabetes through diet+exercise (<5.5 HbA1c)! Lipitor related symptoms (lack of enthusiasm, short term memory loss, muscle pain, bone/joint pain)are showing up (Liver Enzymes were OK in the last blood test, however). Metabolic syndrome is genetic, since my 8 and 4 year children tested with High LDL. Simply don't know what to do to bring LDL down. At this stage it is not clear what is better of the two evils: Lipitor or High LDL? And how to lower LDL without the side effects of statins? Vegetarian diet (approx. 5% saturated fat) and Exercise is already close to perfection based on the available information, but still left elevated LDL/HDL ratio to 5+ if not on Lipitor. 	0	1	0	1	0	short term memory loss|Vegetarian diet|Blurred vision|diabetic|High LDL|don't know|related|controlled|elevated|sleep|perfection|side effects|muscle pain|joint pain|lethargic|fatigued|pain|symptoms|right foot|eyes|bone|eye|enthusiasm|feeling|feel|blood test|Metabolic|stage|diabetes|Liver|syndrome|Exercise|surgery|Bypass|lipitor|Lipitor|fat|statins|lipitor|Lipitor|Enzymes|fat|statins|medicine|Enzymes|Enzymes|waking|tested|year|day|information|immediately|visit|head
517	LIPITOR.687.txt	My dad has been on Lipitor for over a year, they increased his dose by doubling it. Within a month he started to experience lower leg weakness, cramping of the calf muscles after walking only a block and while resting. He read an article about Baycor, Lipitor, etc We asked his M.D. about this & he told us that the side effects of Lipitor were an INFLAMMATORY muscle weakness & degeneration. With my coaxing & the Dr's okay my day stopped Lipitor for one month. His legs did not get better OR worse. The Dr's have him so worried about his cholesterol that he started taking it again. He is now so debilitated, he was using a walker, & his wheelchair is being delivered today. We have been to a Neurologist, Vascular Surgeon, and blood Dr He can no longer drive. He has reduced feeling below the knees, he has fallen 4 times. He is losing the feeling in his right hand and the inability to perform fine motor skills. With all the tests he has had to rule out other causes, it seems that Lipitor is the culprit. Until the dose was doubled my dad was active, able to walk, drive, and enjoy life. If Lipitor is the cause of all these problems, high cholesterol does not look so bad. I would never take or recommend this drug to anyone.

Do the benefits outweigh the severe side effects-Pfizer says it's rare but serious side effects-I know many people that have had the same problem with muscle damage so I would not consider the side effect to be rare and now since I'm off the drug wonder how much permanent damage to my muscles is their due to this awful drug. 	1	1	1	0	0	side effects|muscle pain|blood test|thinking|like|Lipitor|Lipitor|drug|problem|effect|30 days|decided|damage|month|lupus|said|flu|back|severe|had muscle

After 6 months, my speech and swallowing were so bad that I stopped the Lipitor. It is now one year after stopping and I was diagnosed with ALS (which tests later verified was incorrect) and I think that I am beginning to improve in speech and swallowing. but very slowly and I may never get back to where I was before Lipitor. It has also affected my memory.

529	LIPITOR.112.txt	Anxiety, paranoia. I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery. First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor's psychiatric side effects. He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10mg Crestor. In addition, he prescribed a new medication: Niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly). Bottom line: When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165. This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124. So, after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects. Therefore, here is what I've done during the past two months: - Took 500mg of Niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of Lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days. - Two natural pills of Phytosterol. - A cup of tea made of olive leafs. Now, I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months (2,000mg) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics).

My physical (6 days before starting the lipitor) was perfectly normal except for the cholestorol which had jumped from 175 to 220, primarily due to changed job/work conditions/diet/lack of exercise. Have appointment to see doctor again next week. And will discuss further with her. There has been some increase in jo. I discussed lipitor with two friends who are both teaching pharmacologists.

Tired most of the time. Can't get to sleep and then can't get out of bed till late morning or midday. No strength. Loss of breath.

Then when the pain subsided I begin to have some bleeding and I was on day 12 of my cycle. I would rather die than take this drug again. Although It works wonders for my back pain, it is not worth it to go through the uterus pain and cramping. I am going to try and find a sister drug to arthrotec. Its weird because I have been taking this drug off and on for about 4 months and this only has happened to me 3 times, but I have no way of knowing when it will randomly happen and it is not worth it to take that risk.

Up until 3 weeks ago I was taking LIPEX which is SIMVISTATIN - it reduced my cholesterol very satisfactorily. However - over time, the following symptoms developed - pain in hips cannot walk even a short distance due to pain. Legs felt like they had run a marathon! Deep bruising - I thought I was just being clumsy. Joint pain in spine, hips and elbows. Exhaustion. A colleague asked if I was on cholesterol medication and informed me there could be a connection - I found this website - amazed at all the similarities to me - I thought I was going MAD!!! I came of LIPEX 3 weeks ago, muscles feel better, energy levels picking up, but hip pain still throbbing. I also felt like an old woman, I have over the years been to physiotherapists and chiropractors who did not know what to do - recently diagnosed with bursitis in the hips had 2 cortizone injections - still suffering severe hip pain and cannot walk more than 5 yards. Doctor agreed I could be having severe side effects of STATIN drug - has insisted I need my cholesterol attended to - has now put me on BEZALIP (no relation to STATINS so I am told) I haven't filled the script yet - need to do more research.

It kept getting worse and worse - legs began feeling very tired, couldn't go up stairs easily, had cramping events in my legs 3-4 times a day. I took 5mg/day of Lipitor for a year but finally quit as my legs were hurting too much. Most cramping stopped within a couple of days but there was a long tail - it has only been in the last two years that all cramping stopped (having been off since 2005). It did help get my TC down to 180 from 220, and my HDL to 70-90 frum 30. My legs are still very weak even now - but they don't cramp.

There seems to be a consistent occurence of muscle pain and/or liver problems but I wonder how many other problems are not really attributable to lipitor eg see my Bell's palsy. Also I get night muscle cramps but I have had occasional muscle cramps at night since I was a child, Maybe my memory isn't as good as it was but I'm 70 and I still passed one of the hardest bar exams in the country less than 2 years ago.

572	LIPITOR.546.txt	I had been taking Lipitor 10mg for 2 years. About 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps. He switched to Pravachol 20mg. I lasted about 2 weeks. The pain was worse. Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain. It was Statin. I looked that up and found what it does to the body. So, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up. Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10. 2 months later, the pain was back. Twice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriuosly allergic to the Statin. And I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it. When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically. When ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu. And no Aleve, or pain killer would help. I thought I was allergic to the alcohol. But now I know it was the Statin. Here are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomina,abnoraml dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension. During the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these syptoms started out slowly. First came the tinnitus. My Dr sent me to the ear Dr. Found no problem, I would have to live with it. Second, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft. Then came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinocort. During all this I felt like I was 80 years old. My neck hurt, my hips hurt. We got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain. Didn't really help. Insomia was constant. I got hooked on Tylenol PM. I gained a lot of weight. Went to Lindora to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor. Lost 40 lbs. Dr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention. This is when I decided to check it out on the internet. When I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding. That night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it. Then two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma. I have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years. Then I had sinus problems again. My Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear. My Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198/90. I have never in my life had high blood pressure. Dr put me on Norvasc. Then I had two horrible nightmares. I finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor. When I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died. I have all the syptoms. I stopped taking Lipitor that instant. That was one week ago. I'm starting feel a little better. I've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem. He said, no. There is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol. The Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles. I also, asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck. My left shoulder is almost immobile. I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor. I hope it goes away soon. I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing. I would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug. Dr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug. I said, don't you get it, I'm allergic to it. . 	1	1	1	0	0	allergic reaction to drug|effects increased|photosensitivity|side effects|relieve pain|Tylenol PM|Pravachol|Rhinocort|Lipitor|alcohol|Norvasc|Statin|Zoloft|Aleve|relieve pain|Tylenol PM|Pravachol|Rhinocort|Lipitor|alcohol|Norvasc|Statin|Zoloft|Aleve|drug|There|sinus infection|bronchitis|rhinitis|asthma|said|flu|sinus problems|pneumonia|blood pressure|prescription|weight|left shoulder|back|neck|muscle pain|leg cramps|taste loss|nightmares|dry skin|dry eyes|aches|pain|memory loss|depression|loss weight|problem|worse|Found|stand|new|little better|2 years|effects|related|hypertension|2 months|sleep|switched|tinnitus|decided|prevention|physical theraphy|left ear|heart|hips|nose|ear|and muscles|throat|thinking|dreams|think|like|feel|hope|experienced|reaction|hooked|saw|damage|tests|help|week|months|died|see|x-rays|immobile
573	LIPITOR.201.txt	Just before this last Christmas I had a small stroke and spent three days in the hospital. To make a long story short, there are no after effects of the stroke. In other words the symptoms went away. But, my Doc put me on Aggrenox and 20mg of Lipitor. I have very high arches and have had a little tingling in my feet for years. This is really helped with a good arch support. But for the last two months the pain in my feet and calves (and sometimes thigh) has gotten much worse. I cannot walk very far and sleeping has become a problem because of the pain. Because of the preexisting arch problem, I thought it was just naturally getting worse but after finding this web site I am not sure if it is not the Lipitor. On a pain scale it has gone from a 1 or 2 to 7 or 8. I have a followup apointment with my Doctor in two days and was thinking of asking him if I could go off the Lipitor.

Now the pain has gone into my shoulder and upper arm on my left side. Just last week I noticed my right arm is tight also. I can't sleep on either shoulder now. My lower back is also tight again! And I get terrible headaches from the tight neck muscles. I googled muscle pain and Lipitor showed up on the first 6 or 7 entries!! I read all the comments on this page and couldn't believe it!! I see my symptoms over and over! So, I had blood tests done this week and have elevated creatine so was told today to stop Lipitor immediately, and will see my doctor next week. After reading all these comments, I have no doubt that Lipitor is the cause of all this discomfort. I just hope and pray that I can recover from these terrible side effects. I will use vitamin C and other natural things to help my cholesterol. but if that doesn't help. hey. I'd rather die from a heart attack than die a slow painful death on Lipitor.

I am 45 and a half years old and was on 20 mg of Lipitor due to genetically high LDL for a period of seven months. At that point, I started having terrible, migratory joint pain all over my body that was very distinct and pronounced. I also had disabling fatigue and flu-like malaise. Some nights I would go to bed at 6 pm and not get up until 8 or 9 the next morning. I was quite ill. My doctor did tons of lab work to rule out things like rheumatoid arthriitis, lupus, Lyme disease and active parvovirus infection. These all came back NEGATIVE. Finally, I was taken off Lipitor to see if the drug had anything to do with my symptoms. Within 72 hours I noted an improvement; within seven days, the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health. I will not ever take Lipitor again as I believe it is liver-toxic and slowly poisons the patient. It did a great job of lowering my LDL (173 down to 60). My total cholesterol went from 238 down to 143. However, it nearly killed me in the process and I believe it is almost like a slow-acting poison. 	1	1	1	0	0	parvovirus infection|Lyme disease|lupus|flu|rheumatoid arthriitis|total cholesterol|blood pressure|patient|joint pain|fatigue|malaise|ill|symptoms|diabetic|NEGATIVE|never smoked|completely|improvement|smoke|high LDL|Lipitor|active|Lipitor|drug|distinct|period|see|lowering|liver|feet|toxic|like|rule|months|back|distinct|active

The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil. I asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the Lipitor. Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinery tract infection (one of the side-effects) and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again. I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency. I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time and I attributed this to stress but after reading this website I feel it was due to the Lipitor also. I don't think I will take this drug anymore and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol I think I will try this method instead. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.

616	LIPITOR.365.txt	this was the last shot at using a statin to reduce cholesterol ldl. I have tried all the statin drugs, you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc's out there. For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug, it is from the statins. The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make CoQ10. This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints (that's why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness). Remember your heart is a muscle, guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the CoQ10??? If you do some research on the internet, you will find that all these statins make no claims/nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks, but they cause muscle problems i.e. your heart, this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and. I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130, neurosurgeons, who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low. And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don't show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn't mean the lack of CoQ10 isn't breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly. Mine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints (never had this in my life before statins) and bad muscle cramps (also never got those until statins). Granted is you have high blood pressure, high LDL, over weight and maybe smoke, then you probably need something to lower the LDL, if you only have high LDL, you don't. Read the drug company studies, they even say it may help prevent a heart attack when you have 3 of the aforementioned risk factors. 	0	1	0	0	0	arthritis symptoms|heart attacks|heart attack|blood pressure|weight|muscle cramps|joint pain|pains|risk factors|test|Read|help|low|extremely|will find|numbness|probably|able|decrease|problems|smoke|high LDL|listening|Remember|like|studies|cholesterol ldl|drugs|CoQ10|drug|arthritic|statins|statin|prior|CoQ10|CoQ10|arthritic|statins|statin|prior|heart|liver|knees|hip|is muscle|blood|back|functions|severe

Spoke to a psychiatrist and she confirmed that the entire family of Norvasc (called amlodiphine) is known to have psychiatric side effects. A month ago my family physician confirmed that Lipitor is guilty of similar symptoms and agreed to let me off it for three months, until I take my next blood test.

I have been taking lipitor for many years. I started out on 10mgs and now I am on 40mgs. I have had hip replacement, back surgery, and shoulder surgery while on this drug. I have seen my strength decrease dramatically. I have to be on testosterone replacement. My brother is also on Lipitor and has had recent knee surgery for a torn miniscus and ACL. He is also on testosterone therapy. Im only 47 and he is 45. This sounds like alot of physical problems for guys our age. It wasnt until he mentioned that he had heard about the possible dangers that statins have on tendons that I saw all of these other people and their problems with Lipitor. This could be the reason for many things that I have been suffering physically. I am getting off the Lipitor immediately for a few months to see if some of my symptoms get better.

The first day I did my normal excercise routine, ran two miles, lifted weights, etc That night I had neck pain, and thought it was nothing. Took the second tablet the next day. Upon arising on the second day, I noticed that I was very tired. Pain or cramping in both quads (above knee, back of leg). I was not motivated to do anything. Spent most of the day in bed, reading a book, something I rarely do. By the afternoon I could barely function. Felt generally terrible, flu like symptoms, lower back ache, irritable, no motivation, and pain in knuckles, neck, and both upper legs. I had a worse headache than usual (I have migraine), but who knows? Went to the internet and found this site. Saw Lipitor commercial on TV warning about muscle pain. I did not take the tablet today, and I am feeling better. I attribute the condition to the Lipitor, although there is no proof. I am a prostate cancer patient and take a number of other drugs, which raise the LDL. Apparently, some (a few) patients cannot tolerate this drug. I note that there are some on this list who have permanent damage, so it is serious for some of us. My legs are still sore, and feel worse than they did after a day of agressive downhill skiing a week ago. Apparently this works for most, but some people have a severe and not so obvious reaction.

(I stopped the Lipitor myself after reading the label warnings. The pain stopped within days.) He checked the CK reading, which came back negeative. I used to work out at a gym for one hour twice a week, and he suggested that I was getting older and the workouts might be too extreme. I went back to taking the Lipitor and began cutting back on my exercise. After 6 months, in agony, I went for more blood work--everything was negative. After 9 months I stopped the Lipitor myself, but by then I was a mess: couldn't walk, couldn't lift my arms, horrible neck and muscle pain, horrible pain in every tendon in my body, particularly the Achilles tendon and those on the back of the head. My family doctor was at a loss. I went to a NY neurologist, then to a neuromuscular doctor who said it sounded like Lipitor, even though I had been off the Lipitor for almost 6 months.

Doing the shopping or vacuuming was like climbing Everest. Symptoms stopped within a week of stopping Lipitor. I can't believe I spent a year of my life like that. I will not recommend against Lipitor because some people do fine on it but I wish my Drs. had been more open to the idea that it was causing me problems.

About a week ago, in the middle of the night after taking my usual Lipitor dose, while making my nightly trip to the toilet, a severe muscle back cramp almost sent me to the floor. After finishing my business, I hardly could sleep that night. As I got out of bed that morning I started getting severe muscle spasms in the same old place. The spasms lasted most of the day and gradually the intensity, frequency and duration diminished. Since I had done nothing recently to cause a cramp or spasm, and realizing that in the past, the back aches usually were the worst in the morning but got better during the day and best at night just before my Lipitor dose, I suspected Lipitor.

I'm finding it difficult to fit into my clothes due to the bloating. I also find that it makes me a bit drowsy, almost like a sleeping pill. I therefore take it at bedtime but my sleep is not very sound and therefore not refreshing.

Pfizer Inc.(maker of Lipitor) AMOUNT AT ISSUE: $$$ Pending, Cholesterol-Fighting Drug Tied to Liver, Kidney Injury, The Kahn Gauthier Law Group is investigating possible legal actions against Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), to recover for liver or kidney damage suffered by patients prescribed Lipitor. Like other drugs in its class (the statins), Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes. In clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose. Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream., Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back. Malaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms. The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases. Some of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and generalized skin discoloration.

After an ER visit due to severe back spasm/cramp, my Cardiologist suggested going off the drug and in the past 10 days, no cramping, the shoulder pain has eased 80% and I actually feel good. Because of blockage issues I need to move on to another drug like Crestor or Zocar but after reading some of the comments I am concerned.

Discussed it with my PA and cardiologist. My PA stopped the Lipitor. The pain lessened but did not stop. Went to a Ortho MD who gave me 3 Steroid shots and PT. It seemed to help but pain would not stop. Narcs were ordered which helped somewhat but wasn't the answer. MRI showed a slight linear tear in my Rotator Cuff which he wanted to do surgery. Decided against surgery. Both shoulders started to feel better but still couldn't sleep on my left side. My LDL's were through the roof. After almost 10 months off Lipitor, my general MD talked me into starting Sinivastatin 40 mg every day. Well, guess what happened. My shoulder pain suddenly worsen, especially left side.

770	LIPITOR.187.txt	1/7/05-Chest pain, general weakness, depression, anxiety, just not myself , insomnia, fatigue, memory problems, inability to concentrate. Doctors unable to connect the dots (Lipitor = above symptoms). Sure it lowered my cholesterol. But at what cost? I told my doctor I was feeling weak. He commented I see NO reason for you to be weak (Even though he prescribed the Lipitor for me) Well needless to say that was the last time I saw him. I thought I had MS,Lupus,Fibromyalgia or some other illness that has the symptoms I was experiencing. I found that Lipitor could be the reason for all of these symptoms. So, on my own, I stopped the Lipitor (I was only on 10mg per day) Within 48 hours I felt my mood elevating back to normal. So far (I've been off of it for about 5 days now), my chest pain has improved by about 75%. This is no coincidence I am certain. Hopefully my other symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, memory and insomnia will alleviate as well. By the way. my new doctor had prescribed an anti-depressent for me. I never filled it, as my instincts told me it was something more. I am generally a well balanced type of person.

781	LIPITOR.694.txt	I stumbled across this website which was nothing short of a miracle to me. I was searching for answers on why I am in such pain throughout my body, mental confusion at times and also short term memory loss which all seemed to be growing steadily worse for the past few years. I blamed it on stress (with a dying husband), arthritis, advancing age etc and even discussed leg pain and body cramps with my doctor which he attributed chiefly to age and arthritis. I even had tests done on arteries to see if that could be the cause as I have an aortic aneurysem and thought perhaps my problems could be from poor circulation or blockage somewhere. They all checked out okay. It has been unbearable for several weeks now off and on and I suffered fatigue, lack of energy and growing depression and a feeling a fragility where I had always been a strong woman until recent years. I looked up fibromyalgia thinking I might have that but when I casually looked up lipitor the ratings leaped out at me. These people all were experiencing my symptoms!!! THANK YOU for providing this web site it may very well have saved my life. I am contacting my doctor immediately and as of now no more lipitor. It did lower my cholestral but greatly lowered my quality of life and I guess I am going to do exercise and have joined weight watchers and see if I can control it in that manner.

I stopped taking Lipitor and the rash cleared up greatly, but has NEVER gone away completly, flaring up slightly from time to time, but not nearly as bad as it was during dosing with Lipitor. I was not taking any other medications at the time, and never had eczema before. The anti-lipid effect of Lipitor was unusually strong in my case, causing my CHO to drop below 90 (from a baseline of over 200). by the end of the first 2 weeks of dosing, my physician had me cutting the smallest dose tablet in half to be taken once a day.

Thanks for this website and to all you people who have shared your experiences of Lipitor. I finally have my answer!!! . This drug has been destroying every aspect of my life. physical and psychological. It's destroyed my self-confidence, my sex life, my business. And now it looks and feels like the medical establishment is keeping it all a dirty little secret for the sake of the income that statins generate. I'd rather have died outright from a heart attack than suffer as I have the past three years.

800	LIPITOR.168.txt	Started 2 years ago with 10 mg then 6 mos later doc upped to 20. About 3 mos ago I had several severe left leg cramps-never had them before. Then about 2-3 weeks later, woke up and could barely stand and walk. Legs and toes were numb (worse in left), weak, back pain and calves hurt terribly. Walking was possible but only with intense effort and pain. Couldn't stand for more than 1 or 2 minutes-too painful and weak. Waited a couple 3 weeks to see if it would clear up-did not. Went to doc. Took x-rays said everything fine, blood test fine. Interested in doing MRI-thinking nacrotic nerve in lower spine. On an aside he said stop taking lipitor on an off chanch it may be an uncommon reaction. I started looking up lipitor reactions and came across so much info on side effects it was startling. I look back to about 1 1/2 years ago when I no longer had that special feeling that all males experience in my organ and a decreased sex drive (not typical for me). At the time I attributed it to male menopause-being around 54. I went to my accupuncturist and was told my chee was dry. Had 4 treatments over as many weeks. Started to see some improvement. At the onset of symptoms I felt like I would imagine someone that had MS would feel like, swaying, pulling myself up stairs, dragging legs. After having stopped lipitor and acupuncture treatments, I would say I am at about 50 or 55%. I hope I continue to keep getting better as this has really hit my life at a bad time. My cholesterol did go down but If I knew I would have these kinds of problems I would never have started taking the drug nor will I EVER AGAIN take it irregardless of my cholesterol level. I would recommend to those who have not had any lessening of symptons to try accupuncture.

I have had all kinds of test and they all come up negative. I decided to go off lipitor about three days ago to see if this is causing it. I have a freind with the same problem and is on lipitor for about the same amount of time as I have been on it. I'm hoping that this dizziness will go away in time now that I have stopped lipitor.

It went to all of my feet. My dr wanted to keep me on lipitor but when I quit taking I got better gradually. I really had to fight my dr to get him to believe that lipitor was causing this. He put me on another statin after a month of not taking Lipitor and the same thing started to happen. I am now taking herbs for my cholesterol and it is still high but going lower and my feet are doing better. Drug co should inform doctors of these problems so they will understand them when their patients come to them for help and.

908	LIPITOR.227.txt	I've been taking LIPITOR for a few years (had been on Baycol),. a couple of years ago, I began experiencing increasing joint and muscle pain that is now so severe that I am wodering if it's worth living with such pain. I'm very depressed. The pain is often so severe that it limits my ability to walk and climb stairs, to lift anything heavier than a few pounds. I've had some excruciating thigh cramps, and more recently, I have noticed a generalized weakness all over my body. It scares me to stop taking some statin drug because my cholesterol was very high without them, but my quality of life is so drastically affected that I think I have to.

920	LIPITOR.278.txt	Some addedd gas/wind.  (Cont'd - Pt.2) According to my 'GP' (Dr), the UK male 'desireable target' is 5.1 mmol/litre or 196 mg/decilitre. Docs now actually like you to be lower than that if possible. In 1977 (at age 28) with a 'count' of 10mmol/L (385mg/dL), a VERY careful low-chol. diet made virtually NO difference to my count. So I went onto Zocor (new-ish then) and remained on it for 21 years, finally on a dose of 40mg/day with no real side effects - it lowered my count to 5.6mmol/L. As my count started to rise again to 7.8 in 1997 (at age 48), I switched to Lipitor, starting with 20mg/day and then 40mg/day which dropped my count A LOT to just 5.1mmol/L and with an HDL 'good cholesterol' count of 1.6. After a 3-week holiday without pills, my count rose to 10.4, so I went back onto 40mg/day of Lipitor - but my count was still only 6.7, so I put myself onto 80mg/day Lipitor and my count went down to 5.5 - this is the highest dose recommended.

After 6 weeks of taking lipitor and constant pain and twitching I took myself off of the medication.

Intermittent acute pain in both feet, for which I was prescribed Neurontin. Also experienced weakness in legs and knees causing some limping as well as numbness in fingers & general weakness in hands (difficulty removing gas cap on car). After accidentally running out of Lipitor, I noticed a significant improvement in balance within 2-3 days. Also found that blood glucose level dropped significantly both AM and PM after halting Lipitor. I also discontinued Neurontin and began taking coenzyme Q10 120 mg/day.

Every muscle from my waist down was effected, my legs became LEAD, my bladder all but quit working; blood began showing up in my urine, I had every test in the book, went to doctor after doctor, and no one recognized this medication as the problem, until I finally went to a neurologist for my back problems.
